# Grayscale-Quad-Rounding

C heap allocation, deallocation, and a recursive data structure, and implementation of interesting recursive algorithms over the recursive data structure. A quadtree is a tree data structure in which each node has 0 or 4 children. We will use this to represent a square grayscale image with possible subdivision into 4 square quadrants, recursively.

Takes an image as an input, returns a grayscale of the image using quadtrees, arguments being the maximum grayscale difference as well as the maximum number of recursions (max tree depth).
